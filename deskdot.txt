Chapel is rather usable as a general purpose programming language on
the desktop for engineering and scientific research,
as I have argued in my 2022 CHIUW talk (you can watch the video at

Chapel is now my main language, substituting Fortran, C and Python.  "Desk
dot chpl" is rather an ensemble of useful routines than a specific
project; consider them an unpretentious, and far from professional,
toolbox. Here is the list of the modules;  they can be found at
[https://nldias.github.io/software.html]:
   - angles :: from radians to decimals and the other way around.
   - atmgas :: atmospheric gas properties and manipulation.
   - dgrow :: dynamically grow an array to fit an index.
   - nspectrum :: the spectrum from a single FFT.
   - nstat :: statistical stuff.
   - nstrings :: additional string manipulation.
   - pmatrix :: parallel matrix operations.
   - smatrix :: serial matrix operations.
   - ssr :: sort, search, etc. in an array.
   - water :: properties of liquid water.
